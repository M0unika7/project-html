    <h3><i>What is CSS?</i></h3>

        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><del>Css is not neccesary</del> <span style="background-color: yellow;">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li><br>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
        </b>
    </ol>
    <h3><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h3>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Inline - by using the style sttribute inside HTML element 1.</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.
            <mark>However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</mark> 
            because this is easier way to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies astyle to one unique element. 
       ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.<br><br>
       In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set os styles are applied to an element.<br><br>
       There is awide range of selectors avaliable. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elemens to which a style should be applied.</p>
